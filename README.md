#zipline

Mac OS X CLI utility I wrote to deal with the annoyance of never knowing how many times I have to type .. to cd to a certain directory.

This utility should really be a bash script but then I'd have to write Bash and neither of us wants that, do we.

##Installation

Put the binary from /bin in your path and add the contents of zl.sh to your rc file.
